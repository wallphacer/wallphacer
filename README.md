### Hello!

Hello! Wallphacer here.
I'm a Software Engineer, but mainly using GitHub for hobby stuff.
I don't get to write as much code in my free time as I'd like! :sob:

## Current Projects

### Tv Guide
A project desinged to take the tv show's and movies you like to get through, turn them into tv channels and allow you to just click and watch.
I wanted something that took the stress out of having to pick TV show's. Especially when there's 4 or 5 TV Shows and Movies I know I want to get through but find it hard to pick between.
Sort of help me finish more stuff by removing the choice.

#### Tools
- Angular 🚀
- Python 🐍
- FastApi ⚡
- PostGres 🐘

### DM Toolkit
I wanted to learn Rust, and ratatui.
I decided to use those tools to build out a DM console tool that lets you do a few things.
- Create NPC's on the fly
- Create Town Names on the fly
- Create Tavern Names on the fly
- Run Initiative & Combat
    - Track Damage for Monsters too!

 All in one toolkit :grin:

#### Tools
- Rust 🦀
- Ratatui 🐁
